# Adventures of Rorik

## Description

This is a simple text based RPG about Rorik who is tasked by the king to slay a Lich that has been tormenting the kingdom.

## Getting Started

All the java files need to be compiled together to be able to run the game.

I ran this using the in app run command for VSCode with the "Test Runner for Java" extension in the "Extension Pack for Java" package in VSCode.

The entire game can be completed in a terminal and contains basic combat, shopping, and level ups.

## Folder Structure

The general file structure was created with VSCode and follows the following structure:

- `src`: the folder that contains the source files
- `lib`: the folder that contains any dependencies (in this project their aren't, but it needs to be here for the in app compiler I use)
- `bin`: the folder that contains the compiled files
